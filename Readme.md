i10 is an i3-like tiling window manager for Windows 10.
i10 has the goal of being an _almost_ drop in replacement
for i3 on windows - it should be able to read i3 config
files, though some config elements may not work due to the
difference in nature of Windows verses Unix.

### Why?

Most (all?) currently existing tiling window managers for
Windows are designed similar to DWM - with a window list
that is cycled through with no concept of directional inputs.
i10 hopes to emulate i3 in providing a sophistacated window
tree that you can move between via directional inputs as well
as a variety of other methods.  Additionally, i10 is built from
the ground up for supporting Windows 10 which means it supports
virtual desktops, floating windows, pop-up modals, with no
additional configuration.

## Project Status

i10 is under active development and at this point should
not (can not) be used as a daily driver.
