i10 is an i3-like tiling window manager for Windows 10.
i10 has the goal of being an _almost_ drop in replacement
for i3 on windows - it should be able to read i3 config
files, though some config elements may not work due to the
difference in nature of Windows verses Unix.

## Project Status

i10 is under active development and at this point should
not (can not) be used as a daily driver.
